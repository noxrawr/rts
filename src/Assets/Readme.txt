This package contains a simple C# port of the RVO2 Library v2.0.1 along with a demo including two examples from the original code.

The whole library found under Assets/Plugins/RVO is pure C#, meaning it has no dependency on Unity 3D.
Please read the LICENSE.txt in the library directory if you want to include the code in your project.

The author of the C# port can be reached at chezslan@gmail.com

Quick note about examples :

You should be able to add more samples (that will be auto-detected and displayed in the GUI) by simply adding a class that implements the IExample interface.
